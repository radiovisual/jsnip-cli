# jsnip [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/radiovisual/jsnip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/radiovisual/jsnip)

> Get common JavaScript code snippets.

:hamburger: This is my WIP snippet library. Currently this module outputs static code snippets,
but soon I will implement a template system where the function or class names can be
supplied to customize the output.

Note that the React snippets are currently in a React Native flavor and that the
JavaScript is intended to reflect the ES2015 (ES6) syntax. The snippets are all
linted according to the AirBnB Style.

## Install

Install the cli to use on the command line
```
$ npm install --global jsnip
```

Or, you can install and use it within your node projects / build routines

```
$ npm install --save jsnip
```


## Usage

From the cli:

```
$ jsnip reducer
```

Or from Node.js:

```js
const jsnip = require('jsnip');
jsnip('reducer');
```

## Contribution

Currently this module is for my own productivity, so I won't be accepting Pull
Requests that try to impose specific styles or opinions. However I will accept Pull
Requests that aim to populate the snippet library with useful goodies. :hamburger:
